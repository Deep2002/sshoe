**TSTC MS SQL Server Access**

We have created the TSTC MS SQL server access you will use for the INEW 2330 Final Project course. If you have access for another course to the TSTC MS SQL server, use the access we provide you (below) for your Final Project tables/SQL work. Students are responsible for creating all of the SQL tables, etc. required for their Final Project. Please review on Moodle “SQL Naming Conventions” before creating any tables. Students will create their project tables, etc. using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

When using the TSTC MS SQL server, make sure you are using the correct database for this course: 
inew2330[YourTwocharacterSemester: sp,su,fa][twoDigitYear]
`Example: inew2330fa22`

You can accomplish this by issuing the following statement in your SQL Query window before you do any other statements:

use [Course Database name goes here];
```Example: 
use inew2330fa22
```
