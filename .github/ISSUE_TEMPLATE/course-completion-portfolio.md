- [ ] I have merged my `Final Submission` branch merge with the `main` branch in my student assigned `Repository` on GitHub
- [ ] I will schedule an appointment by emailing him (`david.kuehne@tstc.edu`) and setting up a date/time to import my student `Repository` over to my own personal `GitHub Account/Repository` where I will then build my personal portfolio that I will use with future job opportunities
- [ ] After importing a copy of my student `Repository` to my personal GitHub account, I will Review the instructions in `Unit 6 - Portfolio` and the `Portfolio and Project Transfer` in Moodle. And apply that information to create my personal Github Portfolio
###
- [ ] I acknowledge that I understand that after the end of this course I will no longer have access to the `TSTC SQL Server` for this course or the TSTC student assigned `GitHub Repository` for this course.

- Reminder: Consider filling out the course survey, you should already have received, if you have not already done so.
