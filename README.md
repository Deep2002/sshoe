# SNK
*"A shoe store with a wide selection."*

## Detailed Description

SNK offers a wide selection of shoes. In our application, you will find shoes of all types. There are many brands you could choose from, including sneakers, Nike, Jordans, Adidas, Puma, Converse, flip-flops, and all other brands you could imagine.

The goal of this project is to transform our world into a digital one. We know that the shopping experience matters, which is why we are keeping the shopping experience as it is.

There is only one limitation to this project, the shoe store can only be accessed online. There will be no physical store found anywhere in the world.

There are many different varieties of shoes in all different sizes and colors in our current inventory. As shoes are sold, color and size may decrease.
